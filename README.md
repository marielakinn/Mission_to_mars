# Mission to Mars

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a web application that will scrape data from Nasa's websites with a click of a bottom, and display it in a central location.
Additionally, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a non-SQL database (Mongo database), and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
